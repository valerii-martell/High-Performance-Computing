# High Performance Computing

[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/8ee051b94b154a2f96e677723a90bba2)](https://www.codacy.com/gh/valerii-martell/High-Performance-Computing/dashboard?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=valerii-martell/High-Performance-Computing&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

Programming assignments developed as part of an internship at the V.M. Glushkov Institute of Cybernetics of National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. Mostly in MPI via C++. 

**The general principles of parallel computing, Open MP and MP, and before that, are considered in the works in the repository:**

**Lab work number - used technologies - practical mathematical problem solved in the work:**

1. MPI Blocking Communications - Calculation using Taylor series of the value of a hyperbolic function with a given accuracy using
2. MPI Non Blocking and Broadcasts Comminication - Numerical integration by methods of rectangles, trapezoids, etc.
3. MPI Collective Communications - Solving the System of linear equations using the Jacobi method.
4. MPI Custom Data Types - Solving the System of linear equations using LU-decomposition.
5. MPI Cluster - Solution of the two-dimensional Poisson equation (differential equation in partial derivatives) using the finite difference method
6. OpenMP - Finding all (both prime and compound) divisors of a natural number
7. IntelTBB - Numerical integration by methods of rectangles, trapezoids, etc.

**Main problems of parallel computing considered:**
1. Thread/Process Synchronization Problem
2. Mutual Exclusion Problem
3. Clusterization.
